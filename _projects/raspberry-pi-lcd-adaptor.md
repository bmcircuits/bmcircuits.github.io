This custom adaptor board mates directly with a Raspberry Pi’s 40-pin header and bridges the device’s Display Parallel Interface (DPI) to a high-quality LCD panel. The design focuses on signal integrity, EMI control, and accessible bring-up with documented test points.

Key design considerations included impedance-controlled traces, proper termination for RGB signals, and a compact, manufacturable layout.

## Results

- Achieved a crisp, flicker-free image at target resolution
- Added optional backlight dimming circuit and power sequencing
- Built firmware helpers for quick DPI timing changes
